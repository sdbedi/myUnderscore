# myUnderscore
Lightweight implementation of most underscore methods

This is my implementation of the core utility functions within underscore. It comes complete with uni testing, but as you can see, some functions remain to be implemented.

This project began life as an instructional exercise at Hack Reactor. I'd like to finish out the remaining functions, but I don't intend to maintain this as an open source project, and if you're looking for an actual set of utility functions, you're better off using Underscore or Lodash - those projects are actively maintained, with a broad base of contributors. Still, I think this a handy exercise, and a good learning experience.
