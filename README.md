# myUnderscore
Lightweight implementation of most underscore methods

This is my implementation of the core utility functions within underscore. 

This project began life as an instructional exercise at Hack Reactor. I don't intend to do much more with it, and if you're looking for an actual set of utility functions, you're better off using Underscore or Lodash - those projects are actively maintained, with a broad base of contributors. Still, I think this a handy exercise, and a good learning experience.
